Hi, I’m Justin, an economics graduate from California State University, East Bay. I’ve always been curious about how people interact—how financial systems, market dynamics, and individual behaviors intersect to shape the world we live in. 

While pursuing my degree in Economics, I developed a deep appreciation for the power of data to solve complex problems. Whether it’s identifying trends, improving efficiencies, or crafting strategies, I enjoy turning raw information into meaningful narratives that empower decision-making.

When I’m not diving into data, you’ll likely find me exploring new countries, trying new foods, or experimenting with different hobbies.
