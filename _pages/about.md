Hello! 

 I am a recent graduate with a degree in Economics from California State University, East Bay. Throughout my academic career at EastBay as well as the Peralta College System I was interested in learning more about how people interact with one another and how economic systems shape those interactions. My studies focused on understanding the relationships between financial trends, consumer behavior, and market dynamics.
